## Sunflower
> 《Sunflower》是由美国说唱歌手波兹·马龙录唱的一首歌曲，更是动漫《蜘蛛侠：平行宇宙》（这部动漫很好看，推荐去看）的主题曲，曾经我很喜欢这首歌曲，整整一个星期都在单曲循环它。现在，我也把这首歌推荐给你。

Needless to say, I keep her in check

She was a bad bad, nevertheless (yeah)

Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (ayy)

Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (ayy)

Needless to say, I'm keepin' her in check

She was a bad bad, nevertheless

Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck

Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip

Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip

Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt

Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt

Ooh, some things you just can't refuse

She wanna ride me like a cruise

And I'm not tryna lose

Then you're left in the dust

Unless I stuck by ya

You're a sunflower

I think your love would be too much

Or you'll be left in the dust

Unless I stuck by ya

You're the sunflower

You're the sunflower

Every time I'm leavin' on ya (ooh)

You don't make it easy, no, no (no)

Wish I could be there for ya

Give me a reason to (to, to)

Oh, every time I'm walkin' out (ayy)

I can hear you tellin' me to turn around

Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down

Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (now)

I know you're scared of the unknown (known)

You don't wanna be alone (alone)

I know I always come and go (and go)

But it's out of my control

And you'll be left in the dust

Unless I stuck by ya

You're the sunflower

I think your love would be too much

Or you'll be left in the dust

Unless I stuck by ya

You're the sunflower

You're the sunflower
